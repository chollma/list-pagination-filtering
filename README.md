# Dynamic List Pagination & Filtering
> A JavaScript application that dynamically appends an unordered list with links for pagination.

## Background
I built this project as part of my Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree provided by Treehouse. It utilizes vanilla JavaScript to dynamically insert pagination into page that contains an ordered list of any size. The two functions that exist within script.js serve to filter the list to the pre-defined (10 students) number of items allowed per page (showPage) and loop over the entire list of items to dynamically insert <a> tags (addPagination).
  
## Running the Project
To see the project in action, clone this repository to your desktop and open index.html in a browser. The script should automatically run and display the first 10 list items with the appropriate pagination links on the bottom of the page.
