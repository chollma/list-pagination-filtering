# Dynamic List Pagination & Filtering
> A JavaScript application that dynamically appends an unordered list with links for pagination.

## Background
I built this project as part of my Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree. It utilizes vanilla JavaScript to dynamically insert pagination into page that contains an ordered list of any size. The two functions that exist within script.js serve to filter the list to the pre-defined (10 students) number of items allowed per page (showPage) and loop over the entire list of items to dynamically insert <a> tags (addPagination).
